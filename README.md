# Parallax_H48C
Arduino Library for the Parallax H48C 3-Axis Accelerometer

The Parallax H48C 3-Axis Accelerometer was originally designed to work with the BASIC Stamp 2, made by Parallax.  
The basic functionality of the chip has been ported from PBASIC for use with Arduino.

# Usage
Simply declare an object and pass in the data pin, clock pin, and "chip select" pin.  
Data and Clock pins can be shared across multiple accelerometers on a bus, but the chip select must be unique.
